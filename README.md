This repository contains solutions and learning notes for the **Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai** section of the [freeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/).

### 🧪 Unit Testing with Chai
- Basic assertions (`assert`, `isOk`, `isNotOk`)
- Equality checks (`==`, `===`, `.deepEqual`)
- Type and structure testing (arrays, strings, objects)
- Range, value, and property assertions
- Instance and constructor checks

### 🌐 Functional Testing with Chai-HTTP
- Run Functional Tests on API Endpoints (GET, POST, PUT)
- Chain Assertions on HTTP Responses
- Simulate Actions Using a Headless Browser
- Run Functional Tests Using a Headless Browser (Zombie.js)

## 🚀 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Mocha** – JS test framework  
- **Chai** – assertion library
- **Chai-HTTP** – plugin for testing HTTP endpoints
- **Zombie.js** – headless browser for simulating UI
